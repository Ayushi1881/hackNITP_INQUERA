      <p>Many private colleges have reopened in DECEMBER, but for government colleges the prospects of reopening before April 2021 look dull.

      IIT ROPAR has informed that upto April 2021 we will monitor the situation and take a call only if the situation abates, NIT Jalandhar has decided to go online for the next semester and so is the case with many other NITs/IITs/IIITs.

      IITs are having most of the Phd students back on the campus but reopening for UG students is a tough nut because they usually share hostel rooms and live in close network unlike the Phd students.

      Maybe NITs/IITs/IIITs take cue from the private colleges and reopen the campus. Lets hope for the bestðŸ˜ƒ. What do you think? comment down below.</p>
